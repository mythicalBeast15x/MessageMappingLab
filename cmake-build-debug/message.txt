Don't be racist, I am a building
And I've got news for you
Hey there Steven
Blacks and whites are even
How would you feel if the joke was on you
Blacks, whites, Indians and Spanish
They all came from the sea
We all have to share the same world
Trixie won't you sing with me
Hey Stan
Hey there Trixie
What you singing about?
Oh not much, just skyscraper stuff, like racism
Don't be racist, we both are buildings
Listen to what we mean
Love one another
Sisters and brothers
Or we will haunt your dreams
Or we will haunt your dreams
Or we will haunt your dreams
